/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
 * defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new
 * file per style scope.
 *
 * ---- Esto es lo default:
 * require_tree .
 *= require dataTables/jquery.dataTables
 * require_self
 * ---- Pero en su lugar, vamos a elegir de manera mas uno-a-uno:
 * =require bootstrap_and_overrides
 * =require theme_styles
 * =require_tree ./controller_styles
 * =require dataTables/jquery.dataTables
